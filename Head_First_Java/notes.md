# Writing a class with a main()
- Running a program means telling the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to â€œLoad theMyFirstApp class, then start executing its main() method.
- The main() method is where your program starts running.

# System.out.print vs System.out.println
- System.out.println inserts a newline (think of println as printnewline).
- System.out.print keeps printing to the same line
- (If you want each thing you print out to be on its own line, use println. If you want everything to stick together on one line, use print.)
